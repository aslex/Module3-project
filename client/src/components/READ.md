### What Is You've got flat?

You've got flat is an E-mail service tool for apartment seekers that facilitates the flat hunting process by automating an initial request to realtors based off of a users stored preferences.

### The Idea Behind the Project

Finding a flat in the city is one of the most strenous parts of the Berlin experience - dreaded by newcomers and long-established folks alike. Very often viewings with a 100+ hopefuls and bizarre requests by real estate agents at least make for good dinner talk - if you can manage to get invited to a tour, that is. The market is getting tenser by the minute and keeping track of new offers is a time consuming task; not to mention contacting each supplier seperately.

If there only was a way to simplify this more or less repetitive procedure...
With You've got flat we created a tool that leads a user through a form where he can store his preferences concerning desired areas, prize and size ranges as well as extras like having an additional bathroom, wheelchair-accessibility or being able to bring the cat. After filling out the form once, the app will immediately scan available data for matches and sent out either a customized or default message to the provider.

Since timing is everything... (tbc)

### The Project

You've got flat was built as a final project for the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin by Alexandra Servie and Laura Ningel. The timeframe for the project was 8 days.

### Technologies used

The web app was built using ReactJS, Node.js, Express,js and MongoDB. The retrieved data originates from two API's hosted by Immobilienscout24 and Nestoria.

### Future Improvements

Create a profile page (linked in) where users can store a short bio that can be accessed by the realtors via a provided link. Picture etc ---> more personal (?????)
